Notes for week 4 of class

Math libraries

See tutoring schedule if nssy

sep argument to print

numeric data types

floating point numbers imprecise due to rounding (floor ceiling)

16 digit floats approx

type function to determine type

type(thing) => type of thing

floats, ints, strings, etc.

many algorithms are more efficient with ints than floats

div 2 floats : floats

div 2 ints: floats, but possible to truncate to int

modulus operator gives remainder sep.

combining types ints + floats  coerce to float (no lost info, but lost precision

adding .0 coerces to float

implicit typing/casting

round() can round to specified number of digits
 takes 2nd arg
